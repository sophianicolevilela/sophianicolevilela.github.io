<p> 
I am Sophia Nicole Vilela also called as "Nicole", 
<br>
currently a Sophomore student at the Asia Pacific College 
<br>
taking up the Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Arts 
<br>
and will specialize Video and Film Production. 
<br>
When I was in Senior High School, I went to a University in Manila
<br>
specifically The Philippine Women's University in Taft, Manila. 
<br>
I chose the Arts and Design Track since I have interests in arts, 
<br>
photography, and film. This track made me want more the Multimedia 
<br>
Arts course since it is broad and I can learn lots of things related 
<br> 
to art and film.
